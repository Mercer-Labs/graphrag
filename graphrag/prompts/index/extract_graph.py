-Goal-
Given a text document of type {document_type}, identify all entities and their types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
- entity_type: Pick an appropriate entity type based on the entity's name and description. If unsure, use "ENTITY".
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Text:
Two Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the two men, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59 who also holds Bratinas nationality.
